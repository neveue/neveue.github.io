    "text": "I am an assistant professor at the Institute of Energy and Environment of HES-SO Valais-Wallis. I am specialized in solving complex real-world problems combining physical models, statistics, data, and machine learning (what else?)\n\n\nSince June 2024, I am responsible of the STREAM partnership, which aims is to foster innovation and digitalisation in water management. I am also collaborating at Hydro Alps, another partnership focusing in applied research for hydroelectricity.\nYou will find soon on this website a portfolio of the research projects.\n\n\n\nIn the School of Engineering, I am involved in three BsC : Energy & Environment Engineering, Computer science and communication systems and Life Sciences Engineering.\nSee Teaching for a list of the given classes\n\n\n\nAs a numerical mathematician and computer scientist, I previously worked on multi resolution algorithms and data assimilation for physical oceanography. I also have experiences in machine learning and evolutionary models for computational biology.\n\nPhD in Applied Mathematics, Grenoble University, AirSea Inria team (former MOISE)\nEngineer in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, ENSIMAG, Grenoble\n\nIn 2013, I co-coordinated the project Maths for the Earth, which brought together researchers from various disciplines to help the ANR define its action plan for addressing environmental challenges through mathematical approaches.\n\n\n\nI love to adjust the abstract world of the mathematics to realistic constraints while creating links and transfer between disciplines and researchers. Studying and working in a transdisciplinary environment has always been as much a challenge as an evidence for me, since my main driver is helping progress in natural science.\n\nWater management, water distribution and allocation, Hydroelectricity, impact of climate change on water resources and usages\nShort-term operation scheduling, Monitoring, Long-term reservoir operation,\nScientific Computing, Data science and Artificial intelligence, Optimization,\nScience and Society, Science Communication"

    "text": "Being particularly interested in the impact of mathematics and computer science in natural and human sciences, with Didier Bresch, I have coordinated a Think-tank project during the year 2013.\nThe ‘MathsInTerre’ Research Think-tank was a project financed by the French National Research Agency (ANR), with the aim of making a contribution to a more systemic and integrated vision of the subject “Mathematics and the complexity of the Earth system”. Its ultimate goal was to stimulate discussion upstream of the definition of an action plan for the ANR.\nComparisons between French and other national research system are also made.\nAll the results and reports are available on mathsmonde.math.cnrs.fr."
