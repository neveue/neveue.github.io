## **Bio**

**I am an assistant professor at [the Institute of Energy and Environment of HES-SO Valais-Wallis](https://www.hevs.ch/en/applied-research/research-institute-sustainable-energy/).**

Since June 2024 I am responsible of the [STREAM](https://www.hevs.ch/fr/recherche-appliquee-et-developpement-a-la-hes-so-valais-wallis/institut-de-recherche-energie-et-environnement/stream/) partnership, which aims is to foster innovation in digitization for water management

I am also collaborating at [Hydro Alps](https://www.hevs.ch/fr/recherche-appliquee-et-developpement-a-la-hes-so-valais-wallis/institut-systemes-industriels-valais/hydro-alps-200776).

Studying and working in an transdisciplinary environment has always been as much a challenge as an evidence for me, since my main driver is helping progress in natural science. As a numerical mathematician and computer scientist, I previously worked on multi resolution algorithms and data assimilation for physical oceanography. I switched to computational biology working on the combination of data and physics laws to better understand and predict complex molecular behaviors.\
I love to adjust the abstract world of the mathematics to realistic constraints while creating links and transfer between disciplines and researchers.

***You will find soon on this website my list of publications and a portfolio of the research projects.***

## **Interests**Â 

Water management, Scientific Computing, Data science and Artificial intelligence, Optimization, Science Communication
