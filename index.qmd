**I am an assistant professor at [the Institute of Energy and Environment of HES-SO Valais-Wallis](https://www.hevs.ch/en/applied-research/research-institute-sustainable-energy/).** **I am specialized in solving complex real-world problems combining physical models, statistics, data, and machine learning (what else?)**

## Research

Since June 2024, I am responsible of the [STREAM](https://www.hevs.ch/fr/recherche-appliquee-et-developpement-a-la-hes-so-valais-wallis/institut-de-recherche-energie-et-environnement/stream/) partnership, which aims is to foster innovation and digitalisation in water management. I am also collaborating at [Hydro Alps](https://www.hevs.ch/fr/recherche-appliquee-et-developpement-a-la-hes-so-valais-wallis/institut-systemes-industriels-valais/hydro-alps-200776), another partnership focusing in applied research for hydroelectricity.

## Teaching

In the School of Engineering, I am involved in three BsC : Energy & Environment Engineering, **Computer science and communication systems** and Life Sciences Engineering.

*See [Teaching](teaching.qmd) for a list of the given classes*

## Bio

As a numerical mathematician and computer scientist, I previously worked on multi resolution algorithms and data assimilation for physical oceanography. I also have experiences in machine learning and evolutionary models for computational biology.

-   PhD in Applied Mathematics, Grenoble University, [AirSea Inria team](https://team.inria.fr/airsea/en/) (former MOISE)

-   Engineer in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, ENSIMAG, Grenoble

In 2013, I co-coordinated the project [Maths for the Earth](maths-for-the-earth.qmd), which brought together researchers from various disciplines to help the ANR define its action plan for addressing environmental challenges through mathematical approaches.

## **Interests**Â 

I love to adjust the abstract world of the mathematics to realistic constraints while creating links and transfer between disciplines and researchers. Studying and working in a transdisciplinary environment has always been as much a challenge as an evidence for me, since my main driver is helping progress in natural science.

-   Water management, water distribution and allocation, Hydroelectricity, impact of climate change on water resources and usages
-   Short-term operation scheduling, Monitoring, Long-term reservoir operation,
-   Scientific Computing, Data science and Artificial intelligence, Optimization,
-   Science and Society, Science Communication
