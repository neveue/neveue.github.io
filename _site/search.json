As a numerical mathematician and computer scientist, I previously worked on multi resolution algorithms and data assimilation for physical oceanography. I switched to computational biology working on the combination of data and physics laws to better understand and predict complex molecular behaviors.\nI love to adjust the abstract world of the mathematics to realistic constraints while creating links and transfer between disciplines and researchers.\nYou will find soon on this website my list of publications and a portfolio of the research projects.\n\n\n\nWater management, Scientific Computing, Data science and Artificial intelligence, Optimization, Science Communication"

    "text": "Being particularly interested in the impact of mathematics and computer science in natural and human sciences,  with Didier Bresch, I have coordinated a Think-tank project during the year 2013. The ‘MathsInTerre’ Research Think-tank was a project financed by the French National Research Agency (ANR), with the aim of making a contribution to a more systemic and integrated vision of the subject “Mathematics and the complexity of the Earth system”. Its ultimate goal was to stimulate discussion upstream of the definition of an action plan for the ANR.\nComparisons between French and other national research system are also made.\nAll the results and reports are available on mathsmonde.math.cnrs.fr."
