    "text": "I am an assistant professor at the Institute of Energy and Environment of HES-SO Valais-Wallis.\nSince June 2024 I am also responsible of the STREAM partnership, which aims is to foster innovation in digitization for water management\nI am also collaborating at Hydro Alps.\nStudying and working in an transdisciplinary environment has always been as much a challenge as an evidence for me, since my main driver is helping progress in natural science. As a numerical mathematician and computer scientist, I previously worked on multi resolution algorithms and data assimilation for physical oceanography. I switched to computational biology working on the combination of data and physics laws to better understand and predict complex molecular behaviors.\nI love to adjust the abstract world of the mathematics to realistic constraints while creating links and transfer between disciplines and researchers.\nYou will find soon on this website my list of publications and a portfolio of the research projects."
