	abstract = {Low frequency variability of the California Current System ({CCS}) is investigated using circulation estimates based on a 31-year (1980–2010) sequence of historical analyses of the {CCS} calculated using the Regional Ocean Modeling System ({ROMS}) 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system. The leading 3-dimensional multivariate empirical orthogonal functions (3D {EOFs}) of the {CCS} circulation were computed and provide a detailed view of low-frequency circulation variability within the {CCS}. The 3D {EOFs} are used as basis functions for a linear inverse model of the circulation, and several Principal Oscillation Patterns ({POPs}) of the circulation are identiﬁed. The leading {POPs} have periods in the range ∼ 4 − 10 years, and shed light on the 3-dimensional time evolving structure associated with low-frequency variability in the circulation. A particular focus here is coastal upwelling. In particular, a {POP} with a period close to 10 years appears to be preferentially excited as a resonant response to forcing associated with the regional expression of the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation, the North Paciﬁc Gyre Oscillation and the El Niño Southern Oscillation.},

Previously, we introduced the {RigidRMSD} algorithm to compute the {RMSD} corresponding to the rigid-body motion of a molecule. In this study, we go beyond the limits of the rigid-body approximation by taking into account conformational ﬂexibility of the molecule.

	abstract = {A deﬁning feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of numerous membrane-bound organelles that subdivide the intracellular space into distinct compartments. How the eukaryotic cell acquired its internal complexity is still poorly understood. Material exchange among most organelles occurs via vesicles that bud off from a source and speciﬁcally fuse with a target compartment. Central players in the vesicle fusion process are the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ({SNARE}) proteins. These small tail-anchored ({TA}) membrane proteins zipper into elongated four-helix bundles that pull membranes together. {SNARE} proteins are highly conserved among eukaryotes but are thought to be absent in prokaryotes. Here, we identiﬁed {SNARE}-like factors in the genomes of uncultured organisms of Asgard archaea of the Heimdallarchaeota clade, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of eukaryotes. Biochemical experiments show that the archaeal {SNARE}-like proteins can interact with eukaryotic {SNARE} proteins. We did not detect {SNAREs} in a-proteobacteria, the closest relatives of mitochondria, but identiﬁed several genes encoding for {SNARE} proteins in g-proteobacteria of the order Legionellales, pathogens that live inside eukaryotic cells. Very probably, their {SNAREs} stem from lateral gene transfer from eukaryotes. Together, this suggests that the diverse set of eukaryotic {SNAREs} evolved from an archaeal precursor. However, whether Heimdallarchaeota actually have a simpliﬁed endomembrane system will only be seen when we succeed studying these organisms under the microscope.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            We present the results for {CAPRI} Round 30, the first joint {CASP}‐{CAPRI} experiment, which brought together experts from the protein structure prediction and protein–protein docking communities. The Round comprised 25 targets from amongst those submitted for the {CASP}11 prediction experiment of 2014. The targets included mostly homodimers, a few homotetramers, and two heterodimers, and comprised protein chains that could readily be modeled using templates from the Protein Data Bank. On average 24 {CAPRI} groups and 7 {CASP} groups submitted docking predictions for each target, and 12 {CAPRI} groups per target participated in the {CAPRI} scoring experiment. In total more than 9500 models were assessed against the 3D structures of the corresponding target complexes. Results show that the prediction of homodimer assemblies by homology modeling techniques and docking calculations is quite successful for targets featuring large enough subunit interfaces to represent stable associations. Targets with ambiguous or inaccurate oligomeric state assignments, often featuring crystal contact‐sized interfaces, represented a confounding factor. For those, a much poorer prediction performance was achieved, while nonetheless often providing helpful clues on the correct oligomeric state of the protein. The prediction performance was very poor for genuine tetrameric targets, where the inaccuracy of the homology‐built subunit models and the smaller pair‐wise interfaces severely limited the ability to derive the correct assembly mode. Our analysis also shows that docking procedures tend to perform better than standard homology modeling techniques and that highly accurate models of the protein components are not always required to identify their association modes with acceptable accuracy.

              Nitric oxide ({NO}) is a ubiquitous gaseous messenger, but we know little about its early evolution. Here, we analyzed {NO} synthases ({NOS}) in four different species of placozoans—one of the early-branching animal lineages. In contrast to other invertebrates studied,
              Trichoplax
              and
              Hoilungia
              have three distinct {NOS} genes, including {PDZ} domain-containing {NOS}. Using ultra-sensitive capillary electrophoresis assays, we quantified nitrites (products of {NO} oxidation) and
              l
              -citrulline (co-product of {NO} synthesis from
              l
              -arginine), which were affected by {NOS} inhibitors confirming the presence of functional enzymes in
              Trichoplax
              . Using fluorescent single-molecule in situ hybridization, we showed that distinct {NOSs} are expressed in different subpopulations of cells, with a noticeable distribution close to the edge regions of
              Trichoplax
              . These data suggest both the compartmentalized release of {NO} and a greater diversity of cell types in placozoans than anticipated. {NO} receptor machinery includes both canonical and novel {NIT}-domain containing soluble guanylate cyclases as putative {NO}/nitrite/nitrate sensors. Thus, although
              Trichoplax
              and
              Hoilungia
              exemplify the morphologically simplest free-living animals, the complexity of {NO}-{cGMP}-mediated signaling in Placozoa is greater to those in vertebrates. This situation illuminates multiple lineage-specific diversifications of {NOSs} and {NO}/nitrite/nitrate sensors from the common ancestor of Metazoa and the preservation of conservative {NOS} architecture from prokaryotic ancestors.},

            Many intracellular pathogens, such as bacteria and large viruses, enter eukaryotic cells via phagocytosis, then replicate and proliferate inside the host. To avoid degradation in the phagosomes, they have developed strategies to modify vesicle trafficking. Although several strategies of bacteria have been characterized, it is not clear whether viruses also interfere with the vesicle trafficking of the host. Recently, we came across {SNARE} proteins encoded in the genomes of several bacteria of the order Legionellales. These pathogenic bacteria may use {SNAREs} to interfere with vesicle trafficking, since {SNARE} proteins are the core machinery for vesicle fusion during transport. They assemble into membrane‐bridging {SNARE} complexes that bring membranes together. We now have also discovered {SNARE} proteins in the genomes of diverse giant viruses. Our biochemical experiments showed that these proteins are able to form {SNARE} complexes. We also found other key trafficking factors that work together with {SNAREs} such as {NSF}, {SM}, and Rab proteins encoded in the genomes of giant viruses, suggesting that viruses can make use of a large genetic repertoire of trafficking factors. Most giant viruses possess different collections, suggesting that these factors entered the viral genome multiple times. In the future, the molecular role of these factors during viral infection need to be studied.},
