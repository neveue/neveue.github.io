title: "Maths for the Earth"
---

### **Being particularly interested in the impact of mathematics and computer science in natural and human sciences, with Didier Bresch, I have coordinated a Think-tank project during the year 2013**. 

The ‘MathsInTerre’ Research Think-tank was a project financed by the French National Research Agency (ANR), with the aim of making a contribution to a more systemic and integrated vision of the subject “*Mathematics and the complexity of the Earth system*”. Its ultimate goal was to stimulate discussion upstream of the definition of an action plan for the ANR.\
Comparisons between French and other national research system are also made.
